      User Content. "User Content" of a user means any photographs, pictures, content, text, artwork, files, programs, sound, graphics, video, data, product ratings, product comments, or forum post and other similar materials that a user submits, emails or otherwise uses with the Services. "Your User Content" means User Content that you provide to ZymeBalanz. "Media" means any means of conveying information, whether now known or hereafter devised. You are solely responsible for your User Content.
      You assume all risks associated with use of User Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of Your User Content that makes you or any third party personally identifiable.
      License. By using Your User Content with the Services, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to ZymeBalanz an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free and fully paid, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative works of, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use Your User Content, and to grant sublicenses of the foregoing, solely for the purposes of including Your User Content in the Services. You agree to irrevocably waive (and cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your User Content.
      Feedback. ZymeBalanz will treat any feedback or suggestions you provide to ZymeBalanz as non-confidential and non-proprietary. Thus, in the absence of a written agreement with ZymeBalanz to the contrary, you agree that you will not submit to ZymeBalanz any information or ideas that you consider to be confidential or proprietary.
      User Content License Grants. You hereby grant to ZymeBalanz a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid up, transferable right and license, with the right to sublicense through multiple levels of sublicensees, under all of your intellectual property and other rights in Your User Content, to (a) reproduce, distribute, transmit, publicly perform and publicly display Your User Content, in whole or in part, in any manner and Media, (b) modify, adapt, translate and create derivative works from Your User Content, in whole or in part, in any manner and Media, (c) sublicense the foregoing rights, in whole or in part, to any third party, with or without a fee and (d) exercise any and all other present or future rights in Your User Content.
      Name, Trademarks and Likenesses License Grants. You hereby grant to ZymeBalanz a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid up, transferable right and license, with the right to sublicense through multiple levels of sublicensees, under all of your intellectual property and other rights in Your User Content, to use all trademarks, trade names and the names and likenesses of any individuals that appear in Your User Content. You grant ZymeBalanz the right to use the name that you submit in connection with Your User Content.
      Moral Rights. You hereby waive and agree never to assert any claim of Moral Rights in Your User Content against ZymeBalanz or any of ZymeBalanz’s licensees. "Moral Rights" means any right to (a) divulge Your User Content to the public; (b) retract Your User Content from the public; (c) claim authorship of Your User Content; (d) object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of Your User Content; or (e) any and all similar rights, existing under judicial or statutory law of any country or jurisdiction in the world, or under any treaty regardless of whether or not such right is called or generally referred to as a moral right.
      Restrictions. You agree that you will not submit User Content that is unlawful, pornographic, libelous, defamatory, tortious, obscene, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable or that otherwise violates general ZymeBalanz community standards. We expressly reserve the right to remove or not make available any User Content that we deem to be in violation of this Agreement, applicable laws or our community standards in our sole discretion. You agree that you will not upload, post, e-mail or otherwise transmit User Content to us that contain software viruses or any other computer code, files, or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment.
      No Obligation. Although we have the right to include Your User Content in the Service or in any Media, we do not have the obligation to do so. We may, in our sole discretion and for any reason, refuse Your User Content or remove it from our Service at any time. We reserve the right to remove, screen, edit, or reinstate User Content from time to time at our sole discretion and without notice to you. We have no obligation to retain or provide you with copies of Your User Content, nor do we guarantee any confidentiality with respect to Your User Content.
      Advertising. ZymeBalanz and its licensees may publicly display advertisements and other information adjacent to or included with Your User Content. You are not entitled to any compensation for such advertisements. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising are subject to change without specific notice to you.
      Representations and Warranties.

      You may not state or imply that Your User Content is in any way provided, sponsored or endorsed by ZymeBalanz. Because you alone are responsible for Your User Content (and not ZymeBalanz), you may expose yourself to liability if, for example, Your User Content violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

Note that we do not rent, share, sell or trade PII with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
        The content posted by these third parties will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party. We do not provide any PII to these advertisers, third-party websites, or other businesses. These third-party websites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use tracking technology to deliver (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Services directly to your browser or app. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize or optimize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites or businesses are not covered by this Policy but are covered by their respective privacy policies. Some, but not all, third party advertising companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.

        <div class="level3">
        The security of your PII is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is perfectly secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
